##### IDEAS/SUGGESTIONS

```
Hello Mike,

I have got your email and I have an idea I think it might be interesting. Docker getting more and more popular. It's useful tool for DevOps but since it's very young it has a lot of issues particularly security issues. You've asked what I want to get from community, so security problem in docker is want I want and I hope not only I :)

Thank you.
